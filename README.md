# Smart-Door

## __All code is under a full rewrite__
The code is really messy and needs a rewrite. I am working on getting it into a better state to allow it to scale to more doors all at once and be able to control more about the doors. I am not sure about the timeline but work on it has started - Sawyer R. 10/22


A smart door system that allows for multiple modes.
This program has only been desgined to work with a Raspberry Pi currently. Support for other machines will hopefully come in the future.

In order to get this program to work you must reconfigure the code to the ports on your Raspberry Pi that you will be using. You need to make sure that you make a proper face encoding of someone using the Face Encoder file provided. You need to ensure that the encoded face files are put in the same directory that the door program is in. After you have ensured that all of these conditions are met then the program shoud work. Do NOT put anything in the Encodings folder. You may delete encodings add other encodings but do not place anything else in there or the program will not work.
