# Smart-Door
A modular smart door system that allows for multiple configurations of equipment to be used for any use case.
This program has only been desgined to work with a Raspberry Pi currently. Support for other machines will hopefully come in the future.

In order to get this program to work you must recongifure the code to the ports on your Raspberry Pi that you will be using. You need to make sure that you have made a proper face encoding of someone using the Face Encoder file provided. You need to ensure that the encoded face files are put in the same directory that the door program is in. After you have ensured that all of these condidtions are met then the program shoud work.
