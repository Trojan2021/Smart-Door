# Smart Door Project
## About Us
#### We are all first-year engineering students at The Ohio State University. We all met each other at the beginning of the academic year through the STEM Scholars Program. After spending a few months together, we realized that we all a passion for designing and creating. We decided to come together for Hack OHI/O to create a facial recognition door, which was the start of the Smart Door.

## Problem Definition
#### The goal behind the Smart Door is to create a more secure and efficient way to open a door through facial recognition technology. The applications for this technology are limitless. It can be used in college dorms, houses, hotels, and even doggy doors. The Smart Door offers a hands free, COVID safe way to open a door. The audience for the Smart Door can be anyone, but it can be especially useful for people with disabilities who may have trouble opening a door.

## Initial Prototype (HackOHI/O 2021)

#### With the intitial prototype, we were primarily focused on the software part of the project. Getting the facial recognition to work was our top priority. With software being the main focus, we used a tiny, cabinet-sized "door" to unlock and lock. We used a Raspberry Pi to run the code, a webcam for the facial recognition, a servo to lock and unlock the door, and LED lights to indicate if the door was unlocked or locked. After 24 straight hours of working on the project, we earned a spot in the Winners Circle.

## Initial Prototype Improvements (Post-Hack OHI/O 2021)

#### After our success at Hack OHI/O, we wanted to continue the project and improve upon the door. The main features we focused on improving were polishing the facial recognition code and to begin implementing bluetooth. With the addition of bluetooth, the user can lock and unlock the door from their phone. The bluetooth offers an alternative method for the user to lock and unlock the door, which can be especially useful if the user wants to keep the door unlocked for longer than a few seconds.

## Second Prototype (MakeOHI/O 2022)

#### At MakeOHI/O, our primary focus was to upgrade the door and upscale the entire project to an actual door that would be used in the real world. We used servos to lock and unlock the door, a motor to automatically open door when it unlocks, a power supply to run the motor, a Raspberry Pi to run the code, a camera for facial recognition, and LED lights to show the status of the door being locked or unlocked. The code also had to be improved upon to work with the motor and servos to simultaneously unlock, open, close, and lock the door.

## Second Prototype Improvements (Post-Make OHI/O 2022)

#### After MakeOHI/O, we began to upgrade the door handle by having the servos connected directly to the dead bolt and the door handle. With the servos connected directly, the door can be opened both manually and via the facial recognition without ruining the functionability of the door.
